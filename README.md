# r6-status-monitor

I started this project to help me learn a little more about rust while Ubisoft had their heads up their asses 
and couldn't manage to have a working game for a few days

The endpoint I used was just the public api ep thats from this page on ubisofts site: https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status

The webhook in settings is a dead webhook I accidentally commited the first time, but if you want to use this for yourself just replace the webhook in settings and just use cargo to build
